# Final report

Built on the department's own **"Imperial College Individual Project
Template_LaTeX"** (title page, document class, page geometry, chapter order,
bibliography style) rather than the custom template `thesis_v2/` used.
Directory names match the template's own: `introduction/`, `background/`,
`method/`, `result/`, `discussion/`, `conclusion/`, `appendix/`, `title/`,
`bibs/`.

**Compiler: XeLaTeX** (the template's own `fontspec` / Times New Roman
request needs it):

    xelatex main && bibtex main && xelatex main && xelatex main

## Current state

- **Main body: 5,969 words, 12 figures/tables** (Introduction, Background,
  Method, Result, Discussion, Conclusion) -- against the booklet's limit of
  6,000 words / 20 figures. Word count is read from the *typeset* PDF
  (`Chapter 1` to the page before `Appendix A`), not estimated from the
  LaTeX source, because `\SI{}{}`/`\cref{}` expand into several rendered
  words each.
- **Abstract: 248/250 words.**
- **63 pages total.** The main body is now figure-dense on purpose: the
  booklet only marks the body and the appendix, so the graded content
  carries the platform photo, the package architecture, master channel
  health, the disjoint-workspace + mount-fix pair, two real computer-vision
  detection images (RANSAC plane fit and oriented 3D boxes, both from the
  real cameras, not simulation), the pilot's pooled + paired comparison, a
  genuine 3D trajectory plot, and the sim-to-real tracking collage -- 12 of
  the 20 permitted, leaving 8 spare. The appendix carries everything else,
  uncounted.
- **Figures are matplotlib PDFs in the same house style as the platform's
  own data figures** (`figures/make_figures.py`'s `channels()`/`reach()`/
  `clearance()`: muted grey/blue/red, `font.size` 8-9, no display title
  baked into the image -- the LaTeX caption carries that -- collages built
  from small individual panels via `subcaption`).

## The pilot data

**Five** VR operators, not four -- P5 was missed on the first pass. Their
seven sessions (2026-09-02) predate the per-participant folder-naming
convention (generic timestamp names, no task label) and were found by
noticing the untouched generic `session/` directories actually carried
real VR trial data with a *working* `shared_autonomy` flag in
`events.jsonl`, unlike the later, better-named sessions. `parse_label()` in
the extraction script now special-cases P5 and reads condition from that
flag rather than a folder name.

Two participant cohorts, both anonymised (P1-P5 VR, M1-M3 master-arm; never
a real name, including in rendered figure pixels -- grepped in every figure
PDF's extracted text before each commit, after one script briefly put real
first names in a legend before this check caught it).

- **P1-P5**, VR controllers, 23 sessions ($n=13$ direct / $n=10$ shared),
  `sec:pilot-results` (Result) + `app:pilot` (Appendix L,
  `appendix/l_pilot_study.tex`). Pooled and paired: shorter completion
  times and fewer re-grips under shared autonomy, but **more hand travel**,
  a direction that holds in both the pooled and the paired comparison --
  stated plainly in Discussion rather than smoothed over.
- **M1-M3**, the instrumented mannequin master, 9 recorded sessions out of
  16 attempted -- the other 7 are confirmed empty or metadata-less via
  `ros2 bag info`, not an extraction gap. M1's three sessions track the
  simulated joint 15.9-21.2° RMS against M2/M3's under 3°, an order of
  magnitude worse and consistent with this project's own channel-health
  finding.
- Every pilot session polled the real Kinova arms' own joint encoders
  alongside the simulated ones, a live sim-to-real check rather than an
  offline replay: the best-tracking session holds 1.06° RMS, shown as a
  genuine 3D trajectory plot (`figures/make_3d_trajectory.py`), not a 2D
  projection.

Regenerate: `make_pilot_figures.py`, `make_3d_trajectory.py`,
`make_tracking_figure.py`, `make_master_figure.py`, each
`python3 thesis_v3/figures/<script>.py` from the repository root. All
re-derive participant anonymisation from the raw session names before any
plot is drawn -- if the pilot data set grows, extend each script's `ANON`
dict rather than plotting first and anonymising after.

## Checking compliance before submission

    python3 - <<'EOF'
    import pymupdf
    doc = pymupdf.open("main.pdf")
    texts = [p.get_text() for p in doc]
    b1 = next(i for i,t in enumerate(texts) if t.strip().startswith("Chapter 1"))
    b2 = next(i for i,t in enumerate(texts) if t.strip().startswith("Appendix A"))
    print(len(" ".join(texts[b1:b2]).split()), "main body words")
    EOF

Re-run after any edit to `introduction/`, `background/`, `method/`,
`result/`, `discussion/` or `conclusion/`: 6,000 words and 20 figures/tables
are department policy, not house style. This report currently has ~30
words of headroom on the word count and 8 spare figure/table slots --
spend the slots before the words if you add more evidence.
